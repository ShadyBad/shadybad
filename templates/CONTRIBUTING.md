## Contributing

Thanks for your interest! Please:

1. Open an issue describing the change (bug, enhancement, or doc).
2. Fork and create a feature branch: `feat/short-description`.
3. Run lint and tests locally (`make lint` / `make test`).
4. Submit a PR with a clear Problem → Approach → Impact summary.

Coding style:
- Python ≥ 3.10, type hints, `ruff` for lint/format/imports
- Small, composable functions; logs over prints; JSON artifacts for outputs
