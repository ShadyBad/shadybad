# python_algorithms — Typed DSA with Tests

> Maintain core problem‑solving speed with typed, tested Python implementations.

## Highlights
- Type‑hinted solutions with time/space complexity notes
- pytest coverage; simple CLI runners for common katas

## Quickstart
```bash
python -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
pytest -q
```

## Why It Matters
Stronger fundamentals improve data wrangling, feature engineering, and systems reliability across ML projects.
